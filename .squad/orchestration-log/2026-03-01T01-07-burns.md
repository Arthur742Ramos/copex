**Timestamp:** 2026-03-01T01:07:00Z  
**Agent:** Burns (explore, background)

## Spawn Assignment
Analyzed Copex architecture for agent/Squad support.

## Work Summary
- Examined Fleet, Campaign, Tools, MCP, CLI Client infrastructure
- Found no existing agent support framework
- Identified strong building blocks for future integration

## Key Findings
- Copex has mature toolkit infrastructure (ParallelToolExecutor, MCP integration)
- CLI architecture (Typer-based) supports command extension
- Session and checkpoint patterns already in place
- No squad/agent discovery or lifecycle management

## Recommendations
- Evaluated agent/Squad support as feasible
- Pass context to Frink for integration pathway analysis

## Status
Complete. Handoff to Frink for integration assessment.
