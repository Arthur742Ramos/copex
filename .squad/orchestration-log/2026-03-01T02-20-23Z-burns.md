# Orchestration Log — Burns (2026-03-01T02:20:23Z)

**Agent:** Burns (Lead/Architect)  
**Session Duration:** ~300s  
**Task:** Full code review of agent.py, squad.py, cli.py, __init__.py

## Work Performed

- Reviewed `src/copex/agent.py` — APPROVED (unchanged since prior review)
- Reviewed `src/copex/squad.py` — APPROVED WITH NOTES
- Reviewed `src/copex/cli.py` (agent/squad commands) — APPROVED WITH NOTES
- Reviewed `src/copex/__init__.py` (exports) — APPROVED

## Notes & Findings

### Architecture Decisions Validated
- Squad correctly delegates to Fleet for parallel execution (no reimplementation of concurrency)
- Dependency DAG (Lead → Developer∥Tester → Docs) uses Fleet's template interpolation correctly
- Default squad mode in CLI is good UX decision; `--no-squad` opt-out is clean

### Non-Blocking Items for Follow-up
1. Tests needed for SquadCoordinator: default team creation, dependency ordering, prompt building with templates, result aggregation, error propagation
2. Minor type issue: `on_status` callback in `SquadCoordinator.run()` typed as `Any` → should be `Callable[[str, str], None] | None`
3. Encapsulation: `_ROLE_EMOJIS` dict is private but imported by cli.py → either make public (`ROLE_EMOJIS`) or use `SquadAgent.emoji`

## Verdict

**APPROVED WITH NOTES** — code is clean, well-integrated, follows established Copex patterns. Ship-ready.
