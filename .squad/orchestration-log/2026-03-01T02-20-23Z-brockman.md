# Orchestration Log — Brockman (2026-03-01T02:20:23Z)

**Agent:** Brockman (Docs/DevRel)  
**Session Duration:** ~145s  
**Task:** Documentation sync audit. Updated README.md, CHANGELOG.md, IMPROVEMENTS.md, created 2 new examples

## Work Performed

- Audited documentation against v2.7.0 features (Agent support, Squad orchestration, Repo-awareness)
- Updated README.md: added Agent/Squad sections, updated Features list and CLI Commands table (+150 lines)
- Updated CHANGELOG.md: added v2.7.0 release entry covering AgentSession, SquadCoordinator, default mode change (+30 lines)
- Updated IMPROVEMENTS.md: added feature summary and metrics (was empty, +25 lines)
- Created `examples/agent_loop.py`: basic agent loop, JSON Lines output, streaming (+60 lines)
- Created `examples/squad_orchestration.py`: squad task, context auto-discovery, JSON output, custom team (+70 lines)

## Quality Metrics

- ✅ All examples copy-pasteable and follow project style
- ✅ Code examples match actual API (verified against agent.py, squad.py)
- ✅ CLI commands documented with flags and descriptions
- ✅ Python API documented with usage patterns
- ✅ Clear distinction between single-agent and multi-agent modes
- ✅ Default behavior explained (`copex chat` runs squad by default)

## No Changes Required

- `src/copex/agent.py` — comprehensive docstrings already in place
- `src/copex/squad.py` — comprehensive docstrings already in place
- `docs/` directory — UI design docs in place; architecture docs not needed yet
- Tests — documentation-only update, no test changes needed

## Recommendations

- For Arthur (Lead): Consider architecture guide if needed
- For team: Keep README updated as features ship
- For future: IMPROVEMENTS.md is now a living document

## Verdict

**Complete** — All features now documented. No outstanding gaps.
