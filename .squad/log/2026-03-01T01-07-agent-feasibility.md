# Session Log: Agent Feasibility

**Timestamp:** 2026-03-01T01:07:00Z

## Work Completed

### Burns (explore, background)
- Analyzed Copex architecture for agent/Squad support
- Found strong building blocks: Fleet, Campaign, Tools, MCP, CLI infrastructure
- No existing agent support; clear integration points identified

### Frink (explore, background)
- Assessed integration pathways
- Recommended CLI agent mode (`copex agent` command) as primary path
- Estimated effort: ~2 days

## Decisions Made
- Proceed with CLI agent mode implementation
- Next phase: implementation planning and design

## Outcomes
- Agent support deemed feasible and low-risk
- Clear technical pathway identified
- Ready for implementation sprint
