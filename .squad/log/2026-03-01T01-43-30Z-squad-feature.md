# Session Log: Squad Feature Implementation

**Date:** 2026-03-01T01:43:30Z  
**Topic:** Squad coordination module implementation and testing

## Agents Involved

- **Frink (Core Dev):** Implemented squad module with Fleet-based orchestration
- **Hibbert (Tester):** Wrote 50 comprehensive tests

## What Was Done

1. **Squad Module (`src/copex/squad.py`):** SquadCoordinator, SquadTeam, SquadAgent, SquadResult, SquadAgentResult, SquadRole. Uses Fleet executor for parallel Dev + Tester execution after Lead completes. 

2. **CLI Integration:** `copex squad` command in `cli.py` accepts squad config JSON, outputs SquadResult JSON with outcomes and timings.

3. **Public API:** Updated `__init__.py` with all squad exports (SquadCoordinator, SquadTeam, SquadAgent, SquadResult, SquadAgentResult, SquadRole).

4. **Test Suite:** 50 tests across 12 test classes covering role behavior, dataclasses, orchestration, parallel execution, error handling, duration tracking, CLI integration, and end-to-end workflows.

## Key Decisions

- **Fleet integration:** Use existing Fleet for work item queuing and parallel execution
- **Dependency ordering:** Lead runs first, Dev and Tester run in parallel
- **JSON I/O:** CLI uses JSON Lines protocol for subprocess integration

## Outcomes

- ✅ All 524 tests pass (50 new squad tests + 474 existing)
- ✅ Full feature implemented and tested
- ✅ Production-ready and integration-ready

## Next Steps

Squad module is ready for agent spawning and orchestration workflows.
