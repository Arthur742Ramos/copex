# Session Log: Squad as Default Mode
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-01T01:52:32Z

## Team
- **Frink** (Core Dev) — Implemented squad default mode

## Work Completed
- Squad mode set as DEFAULT for `-p "prompt"` flag (no subcommand required)
- `--no-squad` flag added to bypass squad orchestration
- SquadCoordinator orchestration: Lead first, Dev + Tester parallel
- Shell completions updated
- End-to-end testing passed

## Outcomes
Feature ready for use. Default behavior now coordinates Lead → Dev+Tester instead of single-agent chat.
